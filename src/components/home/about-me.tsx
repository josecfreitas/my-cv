      Greetings! I'm a Brazilian programmer with over a decade of experience in
      computer science. I began studying programming at the age of 15 in 2011,
      and since then, I've achieved an impressive academic background, including
      an associate's, bachelor's, and master's degrees in computer science.
      Additionally, I've had the privilege of publishing two articles in
      international events, demonstrating my expertise in the field.

      Throughout my career, I've completed over 200 courses on Alura, a tech
      course platform, and successfully delivered 30+ end-to-end projects
      ranging from Landing Pages to Apps and Systems. My passion for computer
      science drives me to continuously learn, with a particular interest in
      DevOps.
