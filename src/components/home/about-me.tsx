      I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience in computer
      science. I continuously strive for excellence in my career. I started
      programming at 14 in 2011 and have since built an impressive academic
      foundation, earning associate’s, bachelor’s, and master’s degrees in
      computer science. Along the way, I published two articles at international
      conferences, showcasing my expertise.
